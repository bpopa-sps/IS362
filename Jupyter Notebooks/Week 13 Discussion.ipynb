    "The website I selected for this assignment is https://trakt.tv. Trakt.tv allows its users to track movies or show's that they have watched and to rate them on a 1-10 scale. Their algorithm analyses your personal preferences and ratings, compares them to everyone elses' data and then provides recommendations on what movies or shows to watch next. It is very similar to Netflix; however, it does not have the limitation of the only shows currently streaming. "
